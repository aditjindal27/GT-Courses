# GT-Courses

A stressful period for every Georgia Tech student is class registration. Our class choosing process involves three steps: Finding the prerequisites, the best professors, and the average GPA. To find this information, we need to use three different websites which takes a lot of time especially if you're under the time crunch, which trust me you inevitably will be in.

This website solves this problem by providing:

1. An easy to understand prerequisite list for your class, along with class description.

2. Table with teacher name, GPA and RateMyProfessor ratings for easy comparison.
